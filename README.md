# Quantitative-Finance-with-Python
My journey through the book Quantitative Finance with Python: I intend to read it in my spare time to further my understanding of this fascinating subject.

## Coding

Code will probably be mostly my own, inspired by examples from the book. Since the book is fairly theoretical in the beginning, there won’t be much code to start with.

## Notes

Especially at the beginning of the book, there is a lot of theory, and my OneNote notes are available at https://1drv.ms/o/c/2dcd3e5f06c813b9/IgBObjy6zs3yRZRUeK-ZcEhtAUj4CfserHIyMMVAvcSWHj0?e=ecK5PQ.
